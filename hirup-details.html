              <strong>App Description</strong><br>
              Hirup is a mindful breathing app for remote workers to manage their stress. This activity will use the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/box-breathing" target="_blank">box-breathing technique</a> and vibration as the guide. The app provides a calming atmosphere and mindfulness medium between work breaks to help you achieve the best of your day.

            <h4>The Problems</h4>
            <p>
              The development of technology has made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommuting" target="_blank">remote working</a> possible. Connectivity through technologies has made remote workers always on 24/7. This cause them to receive workload even outside working hours and could result to being stressed out. The distress will reduce rational thinking, productivity, work performance and affect overall well-being.

          <!-- Role -->
          <div class="col-lg-12 mb-2">
            <h5>My role is as an coder and project manager</h5>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              I led my team in development phase, I use notion kanban board to help me manage the schedule and work plan, monitor the development process and make adjustment as needed. I also facilitate Scrum framework sprint planning, backlog grooming, daily scrums, sprint reviews and sprint retrospectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did a research and select Apple frameworks and APIs for integration to the project. I used Swift to code for iOS and watchOS platform. I use git version control (Github) to help me manage the project and dividing tasks for my teammates. I also help troubleshoot my teammates technical problems. I also responsible to ensuring the app is successfully published to the App Store and Testflight.

            <h5>Tools and Technology</h5>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              This is a list of what I developed and used in the development process.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit" target="_blank">UIKit</a>
                <p>
                  I chose UIKit to create the user interfaces because most of my teammates still not familiar using SwiftUI and SwiftUI still have limited support on the internet.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata" target="_blank">Core Data</a>
                <p>
                  I used Core Data to store the app' themes in the device storage. Plans for future development, I want to integrate it with CloudKit, so that the app can have downloadable themes feature.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore" target="_blank">Core Animation</a>
                <p>
                  I used Core Animation to create an animation for the circle to behave like a diaphragm (inflate and deflate).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit" target="_blank">HealthKit</a>
                <p>
                  I create a feature "connect to Apple Health" using HealthKit. The purpose is to store users' mindful sessions, so they can check how long they've been practicing mindfulness with Hirup.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimpactfeedbackgenerator" target="_blank">Gesture/Haptic Feedback</a>
                <p>
                  I also implement Haptic Feedback to enhance users breathing experience by feeling the vibration. I adjust the strength and rhythm of the vibration to follow the animation and the breathing steps.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation" target="_blank">AVFoundation</a>
                <p>
                  To help users feel the calming atmosphere, I used AVFoundation to play the background music. I also used AVFoundation to generate audio instruction.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults" target="_blank">UserDefaults</a>
                <p>
                  I used UserDefaults to save user settings, such as enable notification, background music, haptic feedback, audio instruction and selected theme. Since settings only contain a small amount of data and not complex, I chose UserDefaults rather than Core Data.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications" target="_blank">UserNotifications</a>
                <p>
                  I used UserNotifications to create daily notification to encourage user practice mindfulness.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit" target="_blank">WatchKit</a>
                <p>
                  I used the WatchKit framework to develop the watchOS features. 
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1417415-localizations" target="_blank">Localizations</a>
                <p>
                  Localization is the process of making your app support other languages. In this case I made the app with English user interface first then I localized the app to Indonesian language.
                </p>
              </li>

                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/appearance_customization/adopting_ios_dark_mode" target="_blank">Dark Mode</a>
                <p>
                  I store 2 theme hex colors and background images (light and dark) to core data and also set static color at the image assets.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                <p>
                  I used GitHub for version control and collaborate with my teammates. I also manage the branches, merge and solve any conflicts.
                </p>

            <h5>Version</h5>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Applications are always evolving. In the past 3 months, Hirup has went through changes, upgrade, features additions and removals, etc. Scrum framework is very helpful in the development process. Sprint retrospectives shows great influences in term project, especially in changing the application development strategy to get better results in the next sprint.
            </p>
            <p>
              We conducted multiple user testing to help improve app usage and meet the user requirements. As a project manager, I analyze and process the data we got from user testing, and create a new product backlog with product owner and conduct a sprint planning meeting with development team. After that I create the schedule and work plan for the sprint.
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/hirup/hirup-version.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hirup Version">
            <div class="version-description">
              <h6><i class="fas fa-tags"></i>v<span class="number">0.1.0</span></h6>
              <p>
                This version use the 4-7-8 technique to practice breathing. It use countdown timer with 1 minute, 2 minutes and 3 minutes option. The animation is like a pulse and a simple haptic like heart beat. In this version also have a schedule (to make a reminder) and progress screen (to check mindful time). As you can see there is still no background because we want to conduct a user testing for the main feature.
              </p>
              <h6 class="mt-3"><i class="fas fa-tags"></i>v<span class="number">0.2.0</span></h6>
              <p>
                In this version it already have the background. We change the breathing technique to the box breathing technique because most of our users feel the 4-7-8 technique is exhausting. Schedule and progress feature also removed because they are not necessary. The animation also much smoother than before, behaving like a diaphragm (inflate and deflate). In this version, watchOS app is also available.
              </p>
              <h6 class="mt-3"><i class="fas fa-tags"></i>v<span class="number">0.3.0</span></h6>
              <p>
                In this version we change the countdown timer into cycles, because we found out that ideally people do 4 cycles in one sitting. The app also provide user preferences such as enabling or disabling the audio instruction, haptic feedback, and background music. Connect to Apple Health is also available on this version. The instruction also use more friendly words and notification also available. This version also has a feature to detect if you are focus through hand movements on the screen.
              </p>
              <h6 class="mt-3"><i class="fas fa-tags"></i>v<span class="number">1.0.0</span></h6>
              <p>
                This is the latest version, but not the last. In this version I make the circle unmoveable because most of the users find it distracting and made them want to play around with the circle instead of focussing on the breathing. I also created tutorial screen for first time user, because most of the users confuse on how to do the activity.

            <h5>Plans for future development</h5>
            <p>
              I want to record audio instruction with 1 of my teammate voice, so it didn’t feel robotic and feel more calmer. Also I want to make the notification timing more precise with the user conditions.

            <h4>The Challenges</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Applying and facilitating Scrum framework is very challenging for me, because I never apply it before. I learn from the internet and mentors how to facilitate the scrum meetings, creating a product backlog and also making the work plan from sprint planning. I also learn if the process didn't achieve the targets, so I need to move the tasks to the next sprint. I also found that sprint retrospectives shows great influences in term project, especially in changing the development strategy to get better results in the next sprint.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              It was my first time developing an app in watchOS platform. I spent whole night to learn the basic and the infrastructure for creating watchOS apps. I learn how to make an animation on watchOS and I found it wasn't as easy as on iOS. I'm very grateful I can complete the watchOS app on time and it running well.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              Hirup was my first app to enter the App Store. I read the App Store Guidelines carefully and tested the app to make sure it didn't crash or have bugs before submit it. Unfortunately the app got rejected because of the watchOS app icon background, and this is a new lesson for me so that in the future it will not happen again. Thankfully, after fixing the app icon and resubmit the app, the review went well and Hirup is now available on the App Store.
