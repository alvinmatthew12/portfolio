                    As I began my journey in Tokopedia, I played a key role in developing TopAds, the innovative ads platform for Tokopedia. Among the many exciting projects I contributed to was the creation of AutoBid, a cutting-edge feature that has revolutionized the way manual ads are managed. With AutoBid, our system takes charge of bid and budget management, while enabling sellers to focus on selecting their desired products for promotion and setting their group budgets. By leveraging this game-changing tool, TopAds has become an indispensable resource for businesses seeking to optimize their ad campaigns and drive greater success.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another notable project I undertook was the Split Bid Project, a game-changing initiative that has provided TopAds users with unparalleled flexibility and control over their advertising campaigns. With Split Bid, sellers can now split their bids between search and browse product ads, empowering them to set bids according to their preferences and objectives. Building on this success, we are currently working on the next phase of this project, which involves splitting the browse bid by goal type. This groundbreaking enhancement will give sellers even greater ability to focus their ad spend on their desired goals and drive maximum results. By spearheading initiatives like Split Bid, I have helped to position TopAds as a leading-edge platform that delivers tangible results and empowers businesses to achieve their advertising objectives.

              <h5>Affiliate</h5>
              <p>
                I am proud to have played a central role in the creation of Affiliate, a groundbreaking initiative that has revolutionized the way we drive quality traffic to Tokopedia at low cost. Since its launch, over 175,000 affiliates have signed up on the platform, generating an impressive 1.3 million sessions and 35,000+ additional weekly orders. The platform has been designed for maximum scalability and is easily extendable to other businesses in the GOT ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Affiliate as a service currently supports the Traffic & Order Attribution for Tokopedia Marketplace pages. However, given that affiliate marketing is a versatile tool that can be leveraged by any business to promote their links via affiliates and provide commission for the same, we see several opportunities to further enhance our affiliate design to accommodate these cases in the future. Amongst the features currently available in the Affiliate system, we are constantly working to improve and streamline the platform to facilitate easier external party integration.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am proud to share that my contributions to Affiliat were recognized with the "Most Innovative" award at the prestigious Tokopedia Technology Ideal Awards. By pushing the boundaries of what's possible with affiliate marketing, I have helped position Tokopedia as a leading-edge e-commerce platform that delivers value and results to businesses of all sizes.

                  <p>
                    Through Tokopedia Play, users can access a variety of captivating videos showcasing live shopping events, cooking shows, creative endeavors, and sports that are broadcast live or rebroadcast.

            <h5>My Roles</h5>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
              As an iOS Developer at Tokopedia, my role involves developing and maintaining the company's iOS applications. Under the guidance of experienced developers, I am responsible for writing clean and efficient code, collaborating with other team members to design, implement, and test new features, and ensuring the overall quality of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be successful in this role, I need to have a strong foundation in iOS development, including knowledge of Swift programming languages, as well as experience with Xcode, Git, and other common iOS development tools. I also need to be able to work collaboratively in a team environment, communicate effectively with other team members, and manage my own time and priorities effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to technical skills, I am passionate about developing innovative and user-friendly apps that help people shop online more easily. I enjoy thinking creatively about new features and functionalities that can improve the user experience, while also staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in mobile app development.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Tokopedia, I appreciate the supportive and inclusive work environment where everyone can learn and grow. As an iOS Developer, I have the opportunity to work with a team of talented developers, learn new skills, and contribute to the development of a world-class e-commerce platform.

            <h5>As Part of Community</h5>
            <p>
              In addition to my role as an iOS Developer at Tokopedia, I am also passionate about giving back to the developer community. I have participated in several workshops as a mentor, sharing my knowledge and experience with aspiring developers and helping them develop their skills. I have also created an open source library on Github that other developers can use in their own projects. By making this library available to the public, I hope to contribute to the development of the wider developer community and help other developers solve common problems more easily.
            <p>
              Furthermore, I have published several articles on Medium about my experiences as an iOS developer and the latest trends in mobile app development. By sharing my insights and knowledge with others, I hope to help other developers learn and grow, and to contribute to the broader community of developers working to create innovative and user-friendly apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through these activities, I hope to contribute to the development of the wider developer community and to help other developers develop their skills and create great apps. At Tokopedia, I appreciate the company's support for these kinds of initiatives and am proud to be part of a team that values giving back to the community.
